# WebScraping-Imobiliaria-Brognoli
This repo contains python code to perform Scrapping of real data in estate agencies, using the framework Scrapy.

The crawler/scrapper built here has the objective to scrape data from Houses in this estate agency: https://www.brognoli.com.br/

Some plot analysis about the apartments from sale collected can be found here: http://rpubs.com/wesleyjr01

The crawler/scrapper code is developed with  Scrapy FrameWork  [here](https://github.com/wesleyjr01/WebScraping-Imobiliaria-Brognoly/blob/master/brognoly/brognoly/spiders/scrappingImoveis.py) .The output from the scrapping process can be .csv or .json, you decide.

One raw data output from this scrapping process is [here](https://github.com/wesleyjr01/WebScraping-Imobiliaria-Brognoly/blob/master/brognoly/brognoly/spiders/sale_floripa_apartments_brognoly.json). A processed data file after scrapping can be found [here](https://github.com/wesleyjr01/WebScraping-Imobiliaria-Brognoly/blob/master/brognoly/brognoly/spiders/df_sale_floripa_apartments_brognoly.csv).
